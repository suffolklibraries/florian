If health or mobility problems are preventing you or someone you know getting to a branch or mobile library, volunteers from Suffolk Libraries Home Library Service can help.

The service is free and available from most libraries.

Volunteers visit you in your home, discuss which books will interest you (including audio and eBooks) and order them from the library. They then collect the books from the library and deliver them to your door.
