## Why we need your support

**We’re a charity** that provides all of Suffolk’s library services. Many people don’t realise we’re independent from Suffolk County Council.

We haven’t closed any libraries since taking over their control in 2012. In fact, we now reach thousands more people every year, through events, pre-school activities, wellbeing drop-ins, arts residencies and by simply providing a safe, non-judgemental place to be. And we lend physical and digital books – millions of them every year.

Suffolk County Council provides most of our funding. However, our budget is more than a third less than in 2012, and the Council continues to face cuts from central government.

**We make life in Suffolk better** and you can help us carry on our work by donating.

## Understanding how we make life better: Library stories

Whether it’s through connecting older people with each other over a tea and a chat, providing free high speed broadband and work spaces for study and business, or by helping you discover a great read, **we improve the lives of thousands of Suffolk people.**

<blockquote>I found the library when I was at a low place, my confidence was low&hellip; thanks to Chantry Library providing a safe space and helping me feel strong again, I was able to apply for a seasonal job. <br>– <cite>Chantry Library customer</cite></blockquote>

### It’s a space for everybody

<img alt="Sarell Payne and family in a library" src="/images/case-studies/sarelle2.jpg">

My 8 year old is autistic, so he reads a lot and quickly. My son loves to go through the books. There are always themed books on display and if I want to get the kids out, it’s a nice walk&hellip; My family has also used the library at times to look for work and my mum uses the computers and the printing services. It’s a space for everybody. <br>– Sarelle Payne, Woodbridge Library customer</cite>

### I bring my grandchildren here

<img alt="Sarell Payne and family in a library" src="/images/case-studies/dennis.jpg">

Growing up, it felt like the only way for the economically disadvantaged to get educated. You could get a book on history or politics&hellip; I bring my grandchildren here and we’ll all choose some books together. I will come in sometimes just to have a look and speak to the staff here. It’s a good place to come in and have a chat. <br>– Dennis Stevens, Stowmarket Library customer</cite>
