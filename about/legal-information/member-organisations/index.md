We're made up of member organisations who support the 44 Suffolk libraries. Each library works with local people to develop these member organisations.

Friends groups have a say in the running and development of their local library.

The following member organisations are members of Suffolk's Libraries Industrial and Provident Society Limited. Visit their page or [contact the library](/libraries) to find out about joining.
