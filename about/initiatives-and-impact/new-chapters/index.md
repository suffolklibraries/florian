Suffolk Libraries are commissioned to provide a Mental Health and Wellbeing information service, called New Chapters. The service is funded by the Mental Health Pooled fund, which is managed by  Suffolk’s Clinical Commissioning Groups and Suffolk County Council.

We are funded to provide New Chapters as part of a partnership with Suffolk Mind and Suffolk Family Carers. Together we run SAGES, which is Suffolk’s advice, guidance and emotional support service.

New Chapters supports library staff and customers in providing up to date and reliable mental health and wellbeing information and signposting. It also provides mental health and wellbeing training opportunities for our staff to increase awareness and enable our staff to help customers in the best way possible.

The service works in partnership with other organisations and local services across Suffolk, to ensure that libraries are familiar and in touch with what is available in their area. Partnership working is also a great way for other services and organisations to find out more about we can offer to support wellbeing.
