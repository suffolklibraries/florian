title: Business partnerships with Suffolk Libraries
---

Suffolk Libraries is a charity and receives the majority of its funding from Suffolk County Council. To ensure we have the funding to enable the growth and sustainability of our current offer to the people of Suffolk, we are always seeking ways to create partnerships with businesses on a mutually beneficial basis. Becoming a charity has allowed us to think differently about our offer to our customers and, without these constraints, speak with like-minded businesses to discuss working in partnerships.

We have 44 libraries, in high street locations, across the length and breadth of Suffolk and employ over 400 staff. Every year, Suffolk people make a total of more than 3 million visits every year. We are very proud that our libraries are much-loved and well-used in all of the communities they sit in and assist our many customers to work, rest and play. We are not just about books anymore. All libraries offer free wi-fi, we loan out iPads to customers through a partnership with Hughes Electrical, we hold lots of community events such as mother and baby sessions, slimming clubs, music gigs, fashion shows... the list goes on.

Potential ways of working together:

- Joining up to help your company to reach a different audience.
- One-off or regular pop-up promotion of your business in our libraries.
- Permanent concession space for your business in our libraries.
- Sponsorship of one of our many activities to promote your company.

This list is by no means exhaustive. If you would like to discuss any of this further or have your own ideas, please contact Nikki Hulse, Business Development Manager at **nikki.hulse@suffolklibraries.co.uk**
