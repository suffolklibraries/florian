The library’s Northgate Room is the library’s most attractive and striking room. Normally used as the library’s study and reference area, the room is now available to hire for your special day.

The room can hold up to 70 people including participants, celebrants and photographers. It has a full licence from Suffolk Registrars for weddings, naming ceremonies, renewal of vows, commitment ceremonies or civil partnerships.

The Northgate Room offers a unique and historic venue for ceremonies in the heart of Ipswich. It would be a great choice for book lovers, regular library customers or anyone looking for a reasonably priced venue with a difference.

## Costs

The Northgate Room is available to hire for £350 on Fridays and Saturday and £300 Monday to Thursday. This price covers the hire of the room but not the Registrars or other associated costs. The ceremony license also covers the library’s Lecture Hall and Enterprise and Innovation Hub which are available for hire.

## About the Northgate Room

Ipswich County Library is a listed building built in 1924. Its Northgate Room is 100ft long with a vaulted ceiling and old oak bookshelves and tables. It’s a room which celebrates Suffolk’s cultural heritage and historic significance with several coloured glass windows depicting famous historic literary figures, scientists, politicians, artists, soldiers and sailors with links to Suffolk – including life size images of Geoffrey Chaucer, Francis Bacon and Thomas Wolsey. There are also many other smaller coloured glass panels marking the arms of Suffolk towns and commercial families from the county.

## Contact

Anyone interested in booking the venue is encouraged to arrange a visit and discuss their requirements by contacting Ipswich County Library on **01473 927260** or emailing **ceremonies@suffolklibraries.co.uk**.

Suffolk Libraries is grateful to The Suffolk Bridal Co. and Bedwells Florist for their help in setting up a dress rehearsal wedding to showcase how the room would look for a real ceremony.
